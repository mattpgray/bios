# bios
Simple package for obtaining bios information.

There are other packages for obtaining bios information (github.com/jaypipes/ghw), but they are complicated and do other things. This package simply tries to obtain bios information with no complicated or hidden features.

Currently working (?) on Windows and Linux.
